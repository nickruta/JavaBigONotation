# JavaBigONotation
Big O Notations using Java to measure how well a computer algorithm scales as the amount of data involved increases.


The seven common functions used in algorithm analysis in order. Here we assume that a > 1 is a constant.

Growth rates for the seven fundamental functions used in algorithm analysis. We use base a = 2 for the exponential function. The functions are plotted in a log-log chart, to compare the growth rates primarily as slopes. Even so, the exponential function grows too fast to display all its values on the chart. Also, we use the scientific notation for numbers, where aE+b denotes a10b.
